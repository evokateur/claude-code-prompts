- Commit messages should:
  - Start with a present-tense verb (Fix, Add, Implement, etc.)
  - Not include adjectives that sound like praise (comprehensive, best practices, essential)
  - Be concise (60-120 characters)
  - Be a single line
  - Sound like the title of the issue we resolved, and not include the implementation details we learned during implementation
  - End with a period.
