- Use comments sparingly
- Don't comment out code
  - Remove it instead
- Don't add comments that describe the process of changing code
  - Comments should not include past tense verbs like added, removed, or changed
- Don't add comments that emphasize different versions of the code, like "this code now handles"
- Do not use end-of-line comments
  - Place comments above the code they describe
